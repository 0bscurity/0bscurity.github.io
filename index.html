                    &emsp;&emsp;Whether it be writing scripts to automate menial tasks, or 3D designing and printing robot parts,
                    I have always taken an interest in the world of tech. My exposure to software development
                    began about ten years ago, when I discovered that the popular video game Minecraft could be modded using
                    its native language Java. Several courses later, I picked up Python in an effort to create programs
                    using APIs and libraries such as Google Text to Speech (gTTS) and Tkinter.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Transitioning from middle school to high school, I performed a lead 3D designer role in a competitive
                    FTC team from 2015 to 2017, designing dozens of parts using industry software such as Creo CAD.
                    Over the next few years I dual-enrolled in community college, working on a Towson University Information
                    Systems transfer program. During this time I gained different industry experience while supporting my studies and
                    scholarships. Throughout my studies I experimented with many programming languages, including but not
                    limited to Java, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;After completing all degree-related coursework in 2021 my studies were put on pause to make ends
                    meet, but my passion for programming has only grown.
